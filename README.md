## Thank you for reading. Now let's talk about the real stuff.
### This mod adds:
- A few structure, which 1 has a low chance to spawn, the rest have a moderate chance to spawn.
- A **TON** of advancements for you to collect. Some of them relating to me [DevEngie].
- Armor to help you stay alive longer.
- Ban Hammers(Which are the swords FYI). They do a lot of damage the more better you find/craft.
- My own scythe(Weaker than the biggest ban hammer availible).
- Mobs. This is not a joke, I'm being serious.
- New helpful commands (gmc, gms, gma, gmsp)
- Armor to help you stay alive longer.
- A Katana and a Battle Axe.
- Armor to help you stay alive longer.
- **~~T H E M~~** *Ahem* Sorry about that, I meant to say Sharkos.
- A scoreboard to keep track of a certain item.
- NPC's where you can get better armor and tools. (Best being Unobtainium.)

- A gamerule which if it is enabled, a new command is able to be used. It's for lore sake, chill out people. (/startdetectivemode)

~~I also have no care if you just dip this, I just want to show off my modding skills.~~ <- **This is a joke by the way. I really do care if you download this.** Oh and I have been working on this since **2019**. I'm only deciding to upload this now.
