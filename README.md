![This mod adds:](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/dbe6b9d77f3ea4d17a4d9d53762d7b63b32feaed.png)
- A few structures, which 2 have a low chance to spawn, the rest have a higher chance to spawn.
- A **TON** of advancements for you to collect. Some of them relating to me [DevEngie].
- Armor to help you stay alive longer.
- Ban Hammers(Which are the swords FYI). They do a lot of damage the more better you find/craft.
- My own scythe(Weaker than the biggest ban hammer availible). [Changed as of version 1.19.25]
- Mobs. This is not a joke, I'm being serious.
- A Katana and a Battle Axe.
- **~~T H E M~~** *Ahem* Sorry about that, I meant to say Sharkos.
- A scoreboard to keep track of a certain item. [Changed as of version 1.10.25] (Removed as of 6.8.25)
- NPC's where you can get better armor and tools. (Best being Unobtainium.)
- A gamerule which if it is enabled, a new command is able to be used. It's for lore sake, chill out people. (/startdetectivemode)[Changed as of version 12.18.24.]

~~I also have no care if you just dip this, I just want to show off my modding skills.~~ ‚Üê **This is a joke by the way. I really do care if you download this.** Oh and I have been working on this since **2019**. I'm only deciding to upload this now.
Oh and I'm not porting this to CurseForge.
